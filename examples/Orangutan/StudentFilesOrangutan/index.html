          <h2>Orangutan Facts</h2>
          <p>
            Orangutans are great apes are closely related to humans, having in
            common 97% of DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orangutans are extremely patient and intelligent mammals. They are
            very observant and inquisitive, and there are many stories of
            orangutans escaping from zoos after having watched their keepers
            unlock and lock doors.

          <p>
            The Sumatran and Bornean Orangutans' rainforest habitats are
            disappearing at an alarming rate due to deforestation and clearing
            of the land for <b>pulp paper</b> and <b>palm oil plantations</b>,
            with the remaining forest degraded by drought and forest fires.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Logging is an obvious problem for orangutans who spend their lives
              in trees.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fires endanger the orangutans and the smoke confuses them leaving
              them vulnerable to death from loss of habitat (food).
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fires are commonly started to clear the land and undergrowth for
                farming and palm oil plantations.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Palm Oil Plantations are now the leading suppliers for a global
              market that demands more of the tree's versatile oil for cooking,
              cosmetics, and biofuel.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Palm oil plantations often replace tropical forests, killing
                endangered species, uprooting local communities, and
                contributing to the release of climate-warming gases.
              </li>
              <li>
                The orangutans that are displaced starve to death, are killed by
                plantation workers as pests, or die in the fires.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Poaching orangutan infants and hunting for meat also threatens the
              species.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mothers are often killed for their babies, which are then sold
                on the black market for pets as they are cute.
              </li>
              <li>
                Babies cling to their mothers and suckle their mother’s milk
                until the age of 6 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rescued infants are then rehabilitated by volunteers at
                orangutan rescue centres.
              </li>
              <li>

            Over 150 rehabilitated orangutans have been released into the forest
            area to date via the AOP supported Bukit Tigapuluh Sumatran
            Orangutan Reintroduction Project – the only reintroduction site for
            the Critically Endangered Sumatran orangutan.
