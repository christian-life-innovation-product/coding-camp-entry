          <h2>Playful facts about Orangutans</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Malay and Indonesian orang means "person" and utan is derived
              from hutan, which means "forest." Thus, orangutan literally means
              "person of the forest."
            </li>
            <li>
              Orangutans' arms stretch out longer than their bodies - over 7 ft.
              from fingertip to fingertip - and are used to employ a "hookgrip."
              When on the ground, they walk on all fours, using their palms or
              their fists.
            </li>
            <li>
              When male orangutans reach maturity, they develop large cheek
              pads, which female orangutans apparently find attractive.
            </li>
            <li>
              When males are fighting, they charge at each other and break
              branches. If that doesn't scare one of them away, they grapple and
              bite each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the first 4-6 years of his/her life, an infant orangutan holds
              tight to his/her mother's body as she moves through the forest in
              search of fruit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Like humans, orangutans have opposable thumbs. Their big toes are
              also opposable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Orangutans have tremendous strength, which enables them to swing
              from branch to branch and hang upside-down from branches for long
              periods of time to retrieve fruit and eat young leaves.
            </li>
          </ul>
