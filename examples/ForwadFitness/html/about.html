          <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
          <p>
            The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to
            do as part of their daily exercise routine.
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Burpees</dt>
            <dd>
              Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength
              and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and
              extend your hands forwards, kick your feet back and then forward
              quickly and then jump up from a squatted position.<br />
              <button onClick="burpees();">See Example</button>
            </dd>

            <dt>Plank</dt>
            <dd>
              Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a
              push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold a
              position as long as you can.<br />
              <button onClick="plank();">See Example</button>
            </dd>

            <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
            <dd>
              Mountain Climbers are a food cardio exercise. Please your hands on
              the floor in push-up position, then bring one knee up to your
              chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you were
              climbing a mountain).<br />
              <button onClick="mtn();">See Example</button>
            </dd>
