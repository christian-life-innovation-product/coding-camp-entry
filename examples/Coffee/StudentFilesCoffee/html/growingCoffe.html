          <h3>Coffee Plant Care</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The coffee plant thrives under artificial plant lighting indoors.
              The outside temperature in countries outside the Tropic belt is
              too volatile and too cold to allow the tree to develop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water the tree twice per week in what is called a full watering
              and a half watering. In a half watering, simply add some water to
              the soil and allow it to drain. In a full watering, add water,
              allow it to drain, and then add water with fertilizer and allow it
              to drain. The key is to keep the soil most, but well drained.
            </li>
            <li>
              After two or three years flowering and possibly cherries can be
              expected, but do not expect high-quality coffee unless you are at
              a high altitude and are monitoring the conditions of the
              artificial microclimate carefully. In theory, it is feasible to
              grow a high-quality coffee at home under the right conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              To spur flowering, wait until the beginning of winter and
              significantly reduce watering for 2-3 months. When Spring begins
              water the plant well, which should shock it into producing
              flowers. From this point forward, water well and regularly.
              Arabica coffee is self-fertilizing so you will not need to worry
              about pollinating.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the cherries mature you can harvest, pulp, ferment, dry,
              roast, and drink the coffee.
            </li>
          </ul>
